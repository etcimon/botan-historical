AEAD Modes
========================================

.. versionadded:: 1.11.3

AEAD (Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data) modes provide message
encryption, message authentication, and the ability to authenticate additional
data that is not included in the ciphertext (such as a sequence number or
header). It is a subclass of :cpp:class:`Symmetric_Algorithm`.

The AEAD interface can be used directly, or as part of the filter system by
using :cpp:class:`AEAD_Filter` (a subclass of :cpp:class:`Keyed_Filter` which
will be returned by :cpp:func:`get_cipher` if the named cipher is an AEAD mode).

AEAD modes currently available include GCM, OCB, and EAX. All three use a
128-bit block cipher such as AES.

.. cpp:class:: AEAD_Mode

  .. cpp:function:: void set_key(const SymmetricKey& key)

       Set the key

  .. cpp:function:: Key_Length_Specification key_spec() const

       Return the key length specification

  .. cpp:function:: void set_associated_data(const byte ad[], size_t ad_len)

       Set any associated data for this message. For maximum portability between
       different modes, this must be called after :cpp:func:`set_key` and before
       :cpp:func:`start`.

       If the associated data does not change, it is not necessary to call this
       function more than once, even across multiple calls to :cpp:func:`start`
       and :cpp:func:`finish`.

  .. cpp:function:: SafeVector<byte> start(const byte nonce[], size_t nonce_len)

       Start processing a message, using *nonce* as the unique per-message
       value.

       Returns any initial data that should be emitted (for instance a header).

  .. cpp:function:: void update(SafeVector<byte>& buffer, size_t offset = 0)

       Continue processing a message. The *buffer* is an in/out parameter and
       may be resized. In particular, some modes require that all input be
       consumed before any output is produced; with these modes, *buffer* will
       be returned empty.

       On input, the buffer must be sized in blocks of size
       :cpp:func:`update_granularity`. For instance if the update granularity
       was 64, then *buffer* could be 64, 128, 192, ... bytes.

       The first *offset* bytes of *buffer* will be ignored (this allows in
       place processing of a buffer that contains an initial plaintext header)

  .. cpp:function:: void finish(SafeVector<byte>& buffer, size_t offset = 0)

       Complete processing a message with a final input of *buffer*, which is
       treated the same as with :cpp:func:`update`. It must contain at least
       :cpp:func:`final_minimum_size` bytes.

       Note that if you have the entire message in hand, calling finish without
       ever calling update is both efficient and convenient.

  .. cpp:function:: size_t update_granularity() const

       The AEAD interface requires :cpp:func:`update` be called with blocks of
       this size.

  .. cpp:function:: size_t final_minimum_size() const

       The AEAD interface requires :cpp:func:`finish` be called with at least
       this many bytes (which may be zero, or greater than
       :cpp:func:`update_granularity`)

  .. cpp:function:: bool valid_nonce_length(size_t nonce_len) const

       Returns true if *nonce_len* is a valid nonce length for this scheme. For
       EAX and GCM, any length nonces are allowed. OCB allows any value between
       8 and 15 bytes.

  .. cpp:function:: size_t default_nonce_length() const

       Returns a reasonable length for the nonce, typically either 96
       bits, or the only supported length for modes which don't
       support 96 bit nonces.
