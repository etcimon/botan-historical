Version 1.10.1, 2011-07-11
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* A race condition in `AlgorithmFactory` could cause crashes in
  multithreaded code. See
  :botan-devel:`this thread on botan-devel <2011-July/001455>`
  for details and workarounds.

* The return value of ``name`` has changed for GOST 28147-89 and
  Skein-512.  GOST's ``name`` now includes the name of the sbox, and
  Skein's includes the personalization string (if nonempty). This
  allows an object to be properly roundtripped, which is necessary to
  fix the race condition described above.

* A new distribution script is now included, as
  ``src/build-data/scripts/dist.py``

* The ``build.h`` header now includes, if available, an identifier of
  the source revision that was used. This identifier is also included
  in the result of ``version_string``.
